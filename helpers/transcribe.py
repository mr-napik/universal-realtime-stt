    """
    Transcribe a WAV file using the given STT provider.

    Sets up the full streaming pipeline (audio queue, transcript queue,
    sender/receiver tasks), streams audio with real-time pacing, collects
    committed transcripts, and returns the joined result.

    This is a single-session wrapper — it is not designed for session
    respawn. If the provider drops the connection mid-stream the exception
    propagates to the caller (see error handling below).

    Normal flow:
        1. stream_wav_file feeds PCM chunks into audio_queue, then pushes
           None to signal end-of-audio.
        2. stt_session_task's sender forwards chunks to the provider; on
           receiving None it calls end_audio().
        3. The provider commits its final results and closes; the receiver
           drains events, pushes None into transcript_queue, and exits.
        4. transcript_ingest_task collects all segments and returns them.

    Error flow (provider drops connection early):
        1. stt_session_task raises the provider's exception and cancels its
           internal sender.
        2. A done-callback on stt_task clears the `running` flag, which
           stops stream_wav_file's audio chunk loop on its next iteration.
           If the queue fills before that fires, stream_wav_file raises
           QueueFullError (swallowed here — the real error is in stt_task).
        3. After stream_wav_file exits, stt_task is awaited and its exception
           re-raised. Before re-raising, a None sentinel is placed in
           transcript_queue to unblock and cleanly shut down ingest_task.
        4. The provider exception propagates to the caller.

    Args:
        provider: An already-instantiated (but not yet entered) RealtimeSttProvider.
        wav_path: Path to the WAV file (must be PCM 16kHz mono 16-bit).
        chunk_ms: Audio chunk duration in milliseconds.
        sample_rate: Expected sample rate in Hz.
        realtime_factor: Playback speed (1.0 = real-time, 0.0 = no delay).
        silence_s: Silence padding (seconds) added before and after audio for VAD.

    Returns:
        The full transcript as a single string (segments joined by space).

    Raises:
        Any exception raised by stt_session_task (e.g. provider connection
        errors). QueueFullError from the audio stream is suppressed when
        it is a symptom of an STT failure.
